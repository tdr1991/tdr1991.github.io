## Chapter6 - Deep Feedforward Networks
### 6.2 Gradient-Based Learning
For feedforward neural networks, it is important to initialize all weights to small random values. The biases may be initialized to zero or to small positive values.
#### 6.2.1 Cost Function
In most cases, our patametric model defines a distribution *p(y|x;$\theta$)*
