### Education
2016.09--present, Postgraduate student, School of information engineering, Jiangxi University of Science and Technology, China
2011.09--2015.07, B.E, School of information engineering, East China University of Technology, China
### Work experience
2018.08--present, Algorithm engineer, Shenzhen Diagnoa, China
2016.09--2018.07, Intern, Shenzhen Institutes of Advances Technology Chinese Academy Sciences, China
2015.07--2016.08, C++ software engineer, DingLi Corp., Ltd., China  
### Project experience
1. Gettting metro information by request Baidu map or Amap API and generate XML file, then code C++ interface to parse XML
2. Automatically generate Unix-like Makefile by parse Visual Studio project files
3. Automatically download citations of paper's reference, this is a Python implementation of the project. Through the third-party package named pdfminer to convert pdf into text, using regular expressions extract the title of each reference, and then download the corresponding citations by package biopython to access Entrez database
4. Using jekyll static web pages and NexT theme to build my homepage(blog)  
5. Proposed a taxonomaic classifier which based on convolutional neural network for 16s and ITs sequences
6. Utilized a hybrid deep neural network for annotating the pathogenicity of genetic variants
7. Currently, it is thinking how to use LSTM model for predict stock time series
